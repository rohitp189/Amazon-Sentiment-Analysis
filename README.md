# Amazon Sentiment Analysis & Fake Review Detection  

## About the Project  
This application is designed to analyze Amazon product reviews, detect fake reviews, and gain insights into customer sentiment.  

It utilizes AI-powered sentiment analysis and fake review detection to ensure authentic product feedback analysis, helping businesses and customers make informed decisions.  

## Key Features  
- Sentiment Analysis: Identify Positive, Neutral, and Negative reviews.  
- Fake Review Detection: Spot unverified or misleading reviews.  
- Feature Analysis: Highlight key pros and cons of a product.  
- Product Overview: Combines Sentiment & Authenticity for insights.  
- Trust Score Calculation: Get an overall trust score based on review analysis.  

## How Does It Work?  
1. Upload Amazon Reviews (CSV): Select and upload a CSV file containing product reviews. The system will process the data automatically.  
2. AI-Powered Analysis: The model analyzes sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and detects fake reviews.  
3. Review Breakdown: View a detailed summary of sentiment distribution, fake review detection, and feature extraction.  
4. Get a Final Trust Score: The system generates an overall trust score based on sentiment and authenticity.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – NLTK, SpaCy  
- Machine Learning – Scikit-learn  
- Deep Learning (Optional) – TensorFlow/PyTorch for fake review detection  
- Data Visualization – Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Web Framework (Future Scope) – Streamlit/Flask  

## Installation & Setup  
1. Clone this repository: Download or clone the project from GitHub.  
2. Install dependencies: Install required libraries using pip.  
3. Run the sentiment analysis script: Execute the script to analyze reviews.  

## Results & Insights  
- The model achieved 85% accuracy on test data.  
- Most reviews were positive, but a notable percentage were fake or misleading.  
- The trust score helps identify reliable products.  

## Future Improvements  
- Enhance fake review detection with Deep Learning (LSTM/BERT).  
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit.  
- Integrate real-time review scraping from Amazon.  
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
